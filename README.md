Background Context
Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!
Before starting, please read the AirBnB concept page.

First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help you to:

put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
What’s a command interpreter?

A command interpreter allows the user to interact with a program using commands in the form of text lines. It was frequently used until the 1970’s. However, in modern times many command interpreters are replaced by graphical user interfaces and menu-driven interfaces.

Purpose of Command Interpreters
Command interpreters serve many purposes and are more useful than graphical user interfaces in some cases. Details about these cases are given as follows −

Command interpreters have a large range of commands and queries available for different operations. Also, it is much faster to type than to click as is done using graphical user interfaces..
There are some systems that don’t have enough resources to support graphical user interfaces. In those cases, command interpreters can be used.
Scientists and engineers often used command interpreters in scientific environments. Technically advanced users also prefer command interpreters as compared to graphical user interfaces.
People with visual disabilities use command interpreters as they cannot work with graphical user interfaces. Commands and instructions can be displayed using braille displays in command interpreters.
